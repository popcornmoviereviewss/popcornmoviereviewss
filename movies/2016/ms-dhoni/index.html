			<p>India three down in a spot of bother and needing another 160 runs to win the 2011 cricket world cup. In walks the Indian Skipper MS Dhoni and the rest they say is history. The thought itself gives you goosebumps. The biopic covers this and more but is it a worthy biopic of India's most successful captain ever? Lets find out.</p>
			<p>The story is the life and times of MS Dhoni aka Mahi from his struggle days to eventually lifting the 2011 world cup. The story is written efficiently. The screenplay in the first half is a winner. Extremely engaging!! The screenplay in the second half is a bit inconsistent with Dhoni's love life being given a tad more importance but still manages to hold your attention. The dialogues are like MSD 's glovework ...Sharp. Music is hummable but it is the background music that heightens the drama. Neeraj Pandey returning after 'Baby' has done a great job as the director. The VFX is good too!</p>
			<p>Anupam Kher as Pan Singh Dhoni ..Mahi's father is first rate. Bhumika Chawla as his sister is good. Kiara as Sakshi is cute. Disha Patani as Priyanka looks pretty and has done a good job. A special mention of Herry Tangri in a cameo as Yuvraj Singh is bang on! Kumud Mishra and Rajesh Sharma too have done a swell job in their respective roles. All other actors have done a fine job!! Sushant Singh Rajput as Mahendra Singh Dhoni is as close to Captain Cool as anyone can get. Watch him nail the helicopter shot . Watch him emote with a dead pan face like Mahi. The walk ...the talk he is MS Dhoni.</p>
			<p>All in all MS Dhoni surely entertains without any controversy and will win many hearts. As Ravi Shastri rightly put it " Dhoni finishes off in style...a magnificant strike into the crowd....India lift the world cup after 28 years...And it is the Indian Captain who has been absolutely Magnificant in the night of the final".</p>
			<p>PS: Watch it in a theatre near you for a stadium like atmosphere!!</p>
