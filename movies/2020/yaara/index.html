			<p>I decided to handpick the Assamese Movie Bulbul Can Sing. Before I get to the review, I have a small rant. How many of you are aware of the floods in Assam where over 100 people are dead? If you don't know, I don't blame you. Because the Indian media has not covered it enough. From picking up the silliest of stories and presenting them as news items, the media has been utterly disappointing. Everytime you feel they cannot stoop any lower, they always seem to take you by surprise. Just hope normalcy prevails in Assam as soon as possible. Coming back to the review, is the movie worth it, lets find out.</p>
			<p>Bulbul Can Sing is the story of a group of teenagers blooming up to their sexual identities in a small village in Assam. The story is simple with a simple premise, yet it does move you. The screenplay is a slowburn and so you are acquainted with the kids and well versed with their routines. It adds a fresh layer of friendship, a relstionship that is so pure. But, the twist in the tale really breaks your heart as the movie adds a melancholic flavour to the drama. The writing gets dark in a subtle way but in the end, there is hope! The dialogues are like the ones used in our daily lives. Director Rima Das(who has also directed the excellent Village Rockstars, highly recommended on netflix) has done a great job in handling a delicate subject. If you are familiar with her other works, you will know how effectively she immerses the audience into the drama. </p>
			<p>Rima is known to cast non-actors and this film is no different. Banita Thakuriya as Bonnie is excellent. Manoranjan Das as Suman stands out in a character that is conflicted, he leaves a big impact! Arnali Das as Bulbul has tremendous screen presence and in certain scenes her eyes do the talking. Such a find she is!</p>
			<p>Bulbul Can Sing is soft, gentle yet poignant and melancholic. A small film with a biggg heart. Available on Netflix and Highly Recommended!</p>
